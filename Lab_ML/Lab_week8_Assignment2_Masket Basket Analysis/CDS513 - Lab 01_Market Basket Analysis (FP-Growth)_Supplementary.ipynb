    "## A Simple Classification (Market Basket Analysis) using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start demonstrating Python with a simple Market Basket Analysis. In this lab, we are going to explore the Online Retail data set. This work is based on an article written by Chris Moffitt in https://pbpython.com/market-basket-analysis.html\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab we are going to use the CRISP-DM model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Association rules are normally written like this: {Diapers} -> {Beer} which means that there is a strong relationship between customers that purchased diapers and also purchased beer in the same transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the {Diaper} is the **antecedent** and the {Beer} is the **consequent**. Both antecedents and consequents can have multiple items. In other words, {Diaper, Gum} -> {Beer, Chips} is a valid rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support** is the relative frequency that the rules show up. In many instances, you may want to look for high support in order to make sure it is a useful relationship. However, there may be instances where a low support is useful if you are trying to find “hidden” relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence** is a measure of the reliability of the rule. A confidence of .5 in the above example would mean that in 50% of the cases where Diaper and Gum were purchased, the purchase also included Beer and Chips. For product recommendation, a 50% confidence may be perfectly acceptable but in a medical situation, this level may not be high enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lift** is the ratio of the observed support to that expected if the two rules were independent (see wikipedia). The basic rule of thumb is that a lift value close to 1 means the rules were completely independent. Lift values > 1 are generally more “interesting” and could be indicative of a useful rule pattern.\n"
